# Connect4AIC-incomplete-
Salvaged code from an old project

This was a project that I worked with a team a while ago. I was not able to find the complete project code but this is the bulk of the google glass application that we wrote on Android Studio.

This application takes a picture of a connect 4 board while the user is playing. It breaks that picture up and sends it to a remote server which we programmed. The server applies an algorithm to find the best move to make in order to ultimately win the game. Then that information is sent back to the glass and is displayed to the user.
