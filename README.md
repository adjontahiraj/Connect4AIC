# Connect4AIC-incomplete-
Salvaged code from an old project

This is a project that I worked with a team at a hackathon. Due to an error after we build and completed the project, some of the files are lost however this is the bulk of the front end Java code that I worked on for this project.

This application takes a picture of a connect 4 board through the google glass harware while the user is playing. It breaks that picture up and sends it to a remote server. The server applies an algorithm to find the best move to make in order to ultimately win the game. Then that information is sent back to the glass and is displayed to the user.
